# AOES_Cryptosystem
- This is the repository for a new cryptosystem project namely Advanced Onion Encryption Standard (AOES).
- For now this implementation is just for educational purposes.
- I have attached the source code along with some documentation on how AOES is intended to work and analysis of this cryptosystem.

## Tech stack used
- HTML/CSS for FrontEnd.
- NodeJS with cryptography and certain other computations as BackEnd.

### Here I am attaching some UI snapshots for an overview

- We got two functions, Encrypt and Decrypt and they work as shown below.

- An example of how it can work on sensitive financial data

### The computations of encryption and decryption modules are to be upgraded further. (kept for another version).
- This repository is now archived for public view and more changes may be done in future regarding additional functionalities to the system.
- To run the web-app simply go with "npm run start" and enjoy :)
